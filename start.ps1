# Dual-Panel File Manager - Start Script for PowerShell

# This script is responsible for starting the development server
# for the Dual-Panel File Manager application.
# It dynamically checks for Node.js, npm, the presence of node_modules directories, and ffmpeg before running the server.

# If you're running this script for the first time, you might need to set the execution policy.
# You can do this by running the following command in PowerShell as an administrator:
# Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
